Go to PyPI.org or python package index which is a repo of software for python.
To download a package, you need to be inside a virtual environment.
Use the comman python -m pip install followed my the name of the package eg. arrow etc.

ie python -m pip install arrow

Using python -m pip is a good practice to prevent problems
Inspect the properties like the version and the location with the show command

ie python -m show arrow
You can remove the package my using the command line(This does not remove the dependencies that comes with the package. you have to do that manually)
ie python -m uninstall arrow

python -m pip install --upgrade arrow or
python -m pip install -U pip..this means install the latest version and uninstall anyone present

python -m pip install "arrow == 1.0.0"
python -m pip install "arrow > 1.0.0, < 3.0" ...this specifies the version to download for different project requirment
python -m pip install "arrow !=1.0.0"...this means do not install a specific version

You can also install from Github by using the following supported forms;
MyProject @ git+ssh
MyProject @ git+file
MyProject @ git+https
eg: python -m pip install "demo_pkg @ git+https://github.com/codesensei-courses/demo_pkg.git"

You can also install by pointing to your local file directory


INSTALLING OUTSIDE OF A PROJECT 
Install using pipx: https//pypa.github.oi//pipx/, this instal packages inside their own venv
pipx install black

To make sure PATH is configured correctly use;
pipx ensurepath

Alternatively, you can use;
pip install --user black
But this does not automatically set up a venv and you need to do PATH set up yourself.
